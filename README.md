# WebBrowser
Web Browser built incrementally with C#, MySQL, and Git.

# Running the program
To run this program, please open in Visual Studio and build a version to run in debug mode. The current release version
does not handle all bookmark events properly and will return errors. The debug mode generally works well.

# Purpose
This program was built with the intention of learning software construction fundamentals. I learned how to use Git, I learned SQL, 
and I learned C# while writing this program. It was fun. I plan to fix the remaining bugs eventually.
